                <h4>Travel safety</h4>
                <br>

                <p>&#9670; Keep your travel plans, including accommodation details, to yourself.</p>
                <p>&#9670; Don't hitch hike.</p>
                <p>&#9670; Try not to travel at night.</p>
                <p>&#9670; Avoid 'seedier' areas of the cities you visit, especially at night.</p>
                <p>&#9670; Ask your hotel manager for advice on 'safe' versus 'unsafe' local areas.</p>
                <p>&#9670; As a general rule, city streets that include children and women suggest the area is safe for
                    families. </p>
                <p>&#9670; Carry with you at all times the contact details of the Australian embassy. If your city
                    doesn't have an Australian embassy, find out which other country's embassy is available to help you,
                    such as the British embassy.</p>
                <p>&#9670; Keep a photocopy of your passport and all other important documents in a safe place.</p>
                <p>&#9670; Use ATMs during the day, when there are people around.</p>

                                        capital. It’s primarily known for its Fes El Bali walled medina, with medieval
                                        Marinid architecture, vibrant souks and old-world atmosphere. The medina is home
                                        to religious schools such as the 14th-century Bou Inania and Al Attarine, both
                                        decorated with elaborate cedar carvings and ornate tile work..</p>

                                    <p>Marrakesh, a former imperial city in western Morocco, is a major economic center
                                        and home to mosques, palaces and gardens. The medina is a densely packed, walled
                                        medieval city dating to the Berber Empire, with mazelike alleys where thriving
                                        souks (marketplaces) sell traditional textiles, pottery and jewelry. A symbol of
                                        the city, and visible for miles, is the Moorish minaret of 12th-century
                                        Koutoubia Mosque.</p>

                                    <p>Casablanca is a port city and commercial hub in western Morocco, fronting the
                                        Atlantic Ocean. The city's French colonial legacy is seen in its downtown
                                        Mauresque architecture, a blend of Moorish style and European art deco. Standing
                                        partly over the water, the enormous Hassan II Mosque, completed in 1993, has a
                                        210m minaret topped with lasers directed toward Mecca.</p>
